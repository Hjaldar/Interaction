#label type name data
#
#label is what you use to add it to an itam or combine it with othe tags (must be unique)
#type is the NBT data type -- and valid type but list can be used
#name is the name of the data field in the NBT file
#data is what it holds
#

#For now NBT can only be used for loot items.
#
#In addition to normal NBT tags there is an Ench tag as a convenience for enchanting...
#    label ench id lvl
#...and a Group options that simply allows several additions to be put into on label.
